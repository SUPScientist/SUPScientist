# Hello! I'm Phil Bresnahan. Welcome to my GitHub profile

- üë®‚Äçüíª Work: I'm currently working on the repos that you see lower on my profile here, the [COAST-Lab org](https://github.com/COAST-Lab), and the [TinyCamML org](https://github.com/TinyCamML)
- üìö Background: I started as a chemical/environmental engineer, pivoted to chemical oceanography, and am now a coastal water resources specialist (the intersection of environmental engineering and oceanography)
- üåä Water always: When I'm not building tools to learn about the coast or teaching/learning more, I'm usually in or near the water! I love surfing, open water rowing, stand-up and prone paddling, and cycling/running near the water.

### Where I Work üèÑ

*Here's a snippet from our lab's [homepage](https://coast-lab.org/), which I built using GitHub Pages (you can find the source code [here](https://github.com/COAST-Lab/COAST-Lab.github.io)).*  

The Coastal Ocean Applied Science & Technology Lab seeks to find answers to and develop and communicate solutions for our most pressing environmental questions and problems. <a href="/professorBresnahan/">PI Phil Bresnahan</a> and the COAST Lab are situated at the University of North Carolina Wilmington and affiliated with the <a href="https://uncw.edu/earsci/">Department of Earth and Ocean Sciences<a/> and <a href="https://uncw.edu/cms/">Center for Marine Science<a/>.  We focus on coastal water resources and resilience, and we employ a combination of ocean and environmental engineering and applied science approaches. 
    
In short, we seek to contribute to Smart Coasts by:
<ul>
    <li>inventing and deploying cutting-edge connected sensors and platforms,</li>
    <li>engaging with coastal communities in the study and real-time dissemination of critical information, and</li>
    <li>working toward improved ocean, climate, and coastal literacy for students of all ages.</li> 
</ul>

Our tools include (1) existing sensors and our own inventions paired with buoys, profilers, ships, and autonomous systems for <i>in-situ</i> monitoring, (2) satellites and UxS (Uncrewed aerial, surface, and submersible) Systems for remote sensing, and (3) techniques including time-series analysis and machine learning approaches to better understand the changing planet. We enjoy working in the interrelated fields of STEM education, outreach, and participatory science<sup>1</sup> as we firmly believe that our urgent environmental problems demand much more than academic research. We frequently post open code and other design files to GitHub (see links attached to individual projects on this website) and we rely heavily on others' contributions to the free and open source ecosystem as well.

Environmental topics of interest include (but aren't limited to!): 
<ul>
    <li>coastal water quality, acidification, deoxygenation, and eutrophication,</li>
    <li>coastal resilience, water level, waves, and nearshore temperature variability,</li>
    <li>carbon dioxide removal, blue carbon, and carbon cycling,</li>
    <li>low-cost/open-source sensor development to facilitate public participation in scientific research and expanded monitoring networks, and</li>
    <li>platform development and sensor integration for novel sensing approaches.</li>
</ul>

Thanks to [Bgstatic](https://github.com/Bgstatic) for the profile template that got me started with a few ideas and code chunks here!
